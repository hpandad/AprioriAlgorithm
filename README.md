# AprioriAlgorithm
This function uses an apriori algorithm as a frequent pattern mining algorithm, a closed pattern mining algorithm, and a maximal pattern mining algorithm. Given a transaction database in the form of a txt file where the first line is the minimum support and  each line after is a different transaction(for example input could be 2, abc, abd, aef, etc.). The output of the file should first return the frequent itemsets, than the closed itemsets, and lastly the maximal itemsets along with their support.
